WireMe is an IoT development platform based on Scratch with plug and play customizable hardware modules.

This platform facilitates users to **Deploy their IoT systems without writing a single line of code** with the block-based visual programming
language inherited from Scatch.

Users can plug their desired hardware modules to WireMe hub and use the WireMe desktop app to program the sensors and actuators plugged in.
